    <h2>Becoming a member</h2>
    <p>
        We welcome anyone—however knowledgeable, not knowledgeable,
        old, young, from Earth, not from Earth—who wants to be part of our
        community.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feel free to attend our events, join our
        <a href="https://discord.gg/bzjKNG4bUU">group on Discord</a>,
        suggest ideas, take part and/or create initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        We operate on a strict
        <a href="{% url 'coc' %}">Code of Conduct</a> to maintain a safe space.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting new projects</h2>
    <p>
        We want to operate in a do-ocratic fashion. Anyone who wants to start
        a new project or initiative, feel free to pitch the idea
        <a href="https://discord.gg/bzjKNG4bUU">on Discord</a> and then
        implement it. We’ll try to help as much as we can!
    </p>

    <h2>Making decisions</h2>
    <p>
        How groups of people make decisions is a fundamentally difficult problem.
        Until now, given our small size, we didn’t have to make many. The ones
        we did were easy to make. For example, an event can happen when the
        organiser for it can do it in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        As more people take part, more ideas will be on the table and more
        decisions will need to be made. In principle and in practice, we aspire
        to make decisions democratically and consensually.
    </p>

    <h2>Holding the keys</h2>
    <p>
        There is no physical space for Chaitin School to give the keys to.
        However, shared ownership and trust are fundamental to the community
        of the kind we want to have. Thus, sharing admin access to our online
        assets (website, Discord) is standard practice for all members.
    </p>

    <h2>Handling disagreements</h2>
    <p>
        Inevitably, there will be disagreements. How we handle them is one more
        indication of our skills and the quality of our community. We don’t
        want to have rigid rules for such matters, so two points to follow are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Let’s try that our solutions include everyone’s needs. This is in
            contrast to assuming everyone will fend for themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
            Chaitin School wants to be a space that will allow something
            different to exist. With this in mind, let’s try to reconcile
            differences in a way that multiple ideas can flourish.
        </li>
    </ul>
