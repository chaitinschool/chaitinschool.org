    <h2>Denial</h2>
    <p>
        Chaitin School as an organisation is not interested in acquiring money.
    </p>

    <p>
        Looking for funding, as well as managing money are very distracting
        processes, which will cause us to stop focusing on the essence of
        what we really want to do here: learn CS and software engineering.
    </p>

    <h2>Gift economy</h2>
    <p>
        Contradictorily, we continue to desire material assets. This leaves the
        only way of receiving them to be as gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
        We would be very happy if an individual (member or non-member) would
        take over both the cost as well as <em>the decision of what to
        buy</em>—and subsequently gift us the fruits of their trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is something that is already happening. Our friends who own and
        operate buildings and venues provide us with space. People who
        attend the events buy snacks and drinks for everybody to enjoy.
        Interestingly, nobody told them to. The first time they showed up,
        they saw that somebody had bought snacks and drinks. The next time they
        brought themselves.
