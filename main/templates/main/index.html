    <strong>Philosophy</strong> <small>(the why)</small>
    <p>
        school &lt; from Ancient Greek σχολεῖον (skholeîon), from σχολή
        (skholḗ, “spare time, leisure”, later, “conversations and the
        knowledge gained through them during free time; the places
        where these conversations took place”).
        <small>
            (from <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/school#Etymology_2">
                Wiktionary</a>)
        </small>
    </p>
    <p>
        School used to mean leisure; then it came to be the things
        one gained when on leisure. Now it means death. We want to
        change that.
