    <h1>What we do</h1>

    <p>
        We set up events to get better at programming. Currently, we organise a
        reading group and an open source hack night every ~2 weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Find all events in our
        <a href="{% url 'workshop_list' %}">events page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan to do more workshops in the future with coding-oriented
        content. We are not interested in lecture-style presentations or
        invited talks. Our aim is to explore a topic all together. Having
        expertise is something we welcome but it’s not a requirement.
