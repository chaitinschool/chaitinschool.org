    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

    <blockquote>
        <em>
            But then one day, I was driving my little boy to school and I saw
            this quote by Walt Whitman and it was painted on the wall there.
            It said, “Be curious, not judgmental”. I like that.
        </em>
        <br> — Ted Lasso

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        We aim to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with
        the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. We are committed to
        providing a friendly, safe, welcoming environment for everyone,
        regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity,
        socioeconomic status, religion, age.
    </p>
    <p>
        We want to do considerably better than the average group of
        software-industry people in creating a very friendly space. We
        especially want to cater to the needs of people that are members of
        software-industry minorities.
    </p>
    <p>
        We aim to create a safe space in terms of it being completely free of
        bias and prejudice, however, we want to be open to radical ideas and
        different cultures.
    </p>
    <p>
        We want to adopt a collective approach to create a safe and comfortable
        environment for everyone. Let’s all assume an active role to help
        foster this.
    </p>

    <h2>OK behaviour</h2>
    <p>Let’s:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Participate in an honest and authentic way.</li>
        <li>Exercise consideration and respect in our speech and actions.</li>
        <li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of surroundings and of fellow participants.</li>
        <li>Alert fellow community members if you notice someone in distress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Not OK behaviour</h2>
    <p>
        Not OK behaviours includes intimidating, harassing, abusive,
        discriminatory, derogatory, demeaning speech or actions by any
        participant, regardless of their popularity and prominence.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not welcome semi-unfriendly responses and social cues.
        For example, it’s quite an uncomfortable feeling that one experiences
        when they ask something along the lines of “what is X” or “who is Y”
        and someone else responds with “What?! I can’t believe you don’t know
        what X is!” or "Wow! You don’t know who Y is?!”. Let’s all refrain
        from these. Asking about things one does not know is something we want
        to enable and augment as much as possible—not the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not OK behaviour is absolutely not acceptable and will not be tolerated.
        Anyone asked to stop not OK behaviour is expected to comply immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Notify and/or Act</h2>
    <p>
        If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour we have an
        <a href="{% url 'processes' %}#incident-response">Incident response</a>
        process that one can follow. One can also notify someone else, even if
        not sure of the acceptability or unacceptibility of the behaviour. We
        have a list of community members to contact at the
        <a href="#contact-list">bottom of this page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if there is behaviour not outlined as unacceptable by this text,
        yet it causes uncomfortableness, please do follow the above.
    </p>
    <p>
        We take this part very seriously while at the same time we want to
        act with kindness and understanding for all community members.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
        We expect all community participants to abide by this Code of Conduct
        in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all
        one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
    </p>
